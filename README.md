# README

It's just repository to learn and mess up things.
It can be used as journal for my journey for re-learning some of the basic tasks which I frankly didn't learn when I should have.
Don't take this repository seriously, cause I am not going to!
It is powered by [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license. 

### How to use
1. Run `npm install`
2. Need to run two scripts(eventually they would be merged)
    1. `npm run serve` : It would start the server, it would do a hot reload.
    2. `npm run scss` : It would look for changes in scss file and compile.
